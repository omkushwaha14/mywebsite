<h3 id="newsections" class="text-center">TRAVELLING</h3>
<p id="ok"> My favourite hobby is travelling. I like all kinds of travel: by car, by train, by plane, and travelling on foot. I love to travel with a group and without a guide, despite the fact that I often find myself in a difficult situation in unfamiliar places. Usually, I travel with my friends. Most of all I like to travel by train and spend a little time at different places. Although long journeys are tiring me sometimes, but that doesn't stop me. First of all, it’s always nice to stay in a different place for a change. Secondly, I’m interested in seeing new sights, exploring different cultures and else. Third, I love to spend time in beautiful places and admire the beauty of the natural attractions such as mountains, waterfalls, forest lakes, seas and oceans, forests, valleys, hills, etc. I have been in the mountains with my friends one times. Also I visited some parts of Nepal and India. Travelling gives me a good opportunity to learn a lot about the history of the country I visit, to see cultural and historical places, to meet people of different places, to learn a lot about their traditions, customs and culture.</p>

    <h3>Mussoorie Tourism</h3>
    <p>If your idea of the perfect holiday involves tranquil hills, untouched nature and a holiday experience that is unadulterated in the truest sense of the term, Mussoorie is the place you should be heading to. Nestled amidst the foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan ranges, Mussoorie, also known as Queen of The Hills, stands at an altitude of 7000 feet above sea level, and has a cool, pleasant climate throughout the year. The pristine, natural beauty of Mussoorie makes it a very popular choice of holiday for honeymooners. If you want to enjoy the beautiful sight of the rolling green slopes juxtaposed with the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, Mussoorie is the place for you to be. This beautiful hill station is the perfect retreat from the sweltering weather of the plains, and the fact that it was a very popular holiday destination during the British era can be seen from the multitude of British remnants engulfing the city, such as the archaic architecture of the hotels and churches dotting the entire terrain. One of the most popular tourist attractions in Mussoorie is The Mall (also known as the Mall Road), which is a slightly steep boulevard that has eateries and other shops lining its entire stretch. From the little houses spread around the area to the architecture of even the lamp posts, The Mall gives off a distinct colonial vibe.<p/>
